# Context Budget

Purpose: prevent quality drop from context overload.

## Context tiers

- Tier 1 (must keep): active requirements, interfaces, failing tests.
- Tier 2 (keep summary): prior decisions and review findings.
- Tier 3 (archive): old discussions and obsolete alternatives.

## Rules

- Keep active brief to one page equivalent.
- Summarize old notes before adding new detail.
- If a note is not used in two loops, move to archive summary.

## Mandatory summary blocks

For each loop, record:

- What changed
- Why changed
- Open risks
- Next verification step
