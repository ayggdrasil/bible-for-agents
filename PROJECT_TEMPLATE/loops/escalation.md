# Escalation Rules

Purpose: define when human decision is mandatory.

## Escalate immediately

- Security or privacy impact is unclear.
- Data loss risk exists.
- Cost impact exceeds agreed budget.
- Legal/compliance requirement is ambiguous.

## Escalate before merge

- Tradeoff changes product behavior significantly.
- Required eval target is missed.
- Temporary workaround is needed for release.
